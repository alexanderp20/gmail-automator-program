    <p>Hi,</p>

    <p>
      I am a student at Brown University working with a team on a research
      project about the future of retail, with a focus on how AI and apps are impacting convenience stores.
    </p>

    <p>
      Our goal is to gather insights that will help us build a product that can adapt to the rapidly evolving
      c-store industry while saving you time and making you more money. We are not here to sell anything.
      This is purely research for now, but once we create the product, we would like to give you first access
      to try it out for free.
    </p>

    <p>
      Would you be open to a brief phone conversation sometime next week to share your perspective?
      Your experience would be invaluable in shaping something that could directly benefit people in your industry.
    </p>

    <p>Thanks so much,<br>Alexander Pak</p>
